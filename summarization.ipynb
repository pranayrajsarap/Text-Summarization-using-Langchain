    "People across the country, involved in government, political, and social activities, are dedicating their time to make the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ (Developed India Resolution Journey) successful. Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it was my responsibility to also contribute my time to this program. So, today, I have come here just as a Member of Parliament and your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, much like you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our country, governments have come and gone, numerous schemes have been formulated, discussions have taken place, and big promises have been made. However, my experience and observations led me to believe that the most critical aspect that requires attention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without any hassles. If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and the people across the country whether what I envisioned and the work I have been doing aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken place. I recently met some individuals who utilized the Ayushman card to get treatment for serious illnesses. One person met with a severe accident, and after using the card, he could afford the necessary operation, and now he is recovering well. When I asked him, he said: “How could I afford this treatment? Now that there is the Ayushman card, I mustered courage and underwent an operation. Now I am perfectly fine.”  Such stories are blessings to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bureaucrats, who prepare good schemes, expedite the paperwork and even allocate funds, also feel satisfied that 50 or 100 people who were supposed to get the funds have got it. The funds meant for a thousand villages have been released. But their job satisfaction peaks when they hear that their work has directly impacted someone’s life positively. When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job. When a government officer listens to such stories, he feels very satisfied.\n",

       "[Document(page_content='People across the country, involved in government, political, and social activities, are \\ndedicating their time to make the ‘Viksit  Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ (Developed India Resolution \\nJourney) successful. Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it was my responsibility to also \\ncontribute my time to this program. So, today, I have come here just as a Member of \\nParliament and your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, much like you.  \\n \\nIn our country, governments have come and gone, numerous schemes have been \\nformulated, discussions have taken place, and big promises have been made. However, my \\nexperience and observations led me to believe that the most critical aspect that requires \\nattention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without \\nany hassles. If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), \\nthen those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he  should not \\nneed to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should \\nreach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have \\ngot their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where  someone is left out of \\nthe government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to \\npeople’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the \\nintended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned \\nwithout paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this \\n‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and \\nthe people across the country whether w hat I envisioned and the work I have been doing \\naligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.  \\n \\nIt is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken \\nplace. I recently met some individuals who utilized the Ayushman card to get treatment for \\nserious illnesses. One person met with a severe accident, and after using the ca rd, he \\ncould afford the necessary operation, and now he is recovering well. When I asked him, he \\nsaid: “How could I afford this treatment? Now that there is the Ayushman card, I mustered \\ncourage and underwent an operation. Now I am perfectly fine.”  Such s tories are blessings \\nto me.  \\n \\nThe bureaucrats, who prepare good schemes, expedite the paperwork and even allocate \\nfunds, also feel satisfied that 50 or 100 people who were supposed to get the funds have \\ngot it. The funds meant for a thousand villages have been released. But their job \\nsatisfaction peaks when they hear that their work has directly impacted someone’s life \\npositively. When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. \\nThey feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a posi tive impact on \\ngovernment officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially \\nwhen they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied \\nwith their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and  the intended beneficiaries \\nreceived the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the \\nJeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they \\nhave done a good job. When a government office r listens to such stories, he feels very \\nsatisfied.   \\nThere are very few who understand the power and impact of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp \\nYatra’. When I hear people connected to bureaucratic circles talking about it, expressing \\ntheir satisfaction, it resonates with me. I’ve heard stories where someone sudden ly \\nreceived 2 lakh rupees after the death of her husband, and a sister mentioned how the \\narrival of gas in her home transformed her lives. The most significant aspect is when \\nsomeone says that the line between rich and poor has vanished. While the slogan ‘ Garibi \\nHatao’ (Remove Poverty) is one thing, but the real change happens when a person says, “As \\nsoon as the gas stove came to my house, the distinction between poverty and affluence \\ndisappeared.')]"
